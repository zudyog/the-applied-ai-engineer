# retrieval/rerank_client.py
# Source: Book 2, Chapter 9 — Real Production
# Sync HTTP client for the rerank microservice (../shopbot-rerank/main.py — a
# separate, standalone project, not a subfolder of this one).
# Cross-encoder reranking always runs there — this process has no in-process
# CrossEncoder fallback, so RERANK_URL is required (run ../shopbot-rerank/ via
# Docker locally, same as in production).
#
# Synchronous by design: the whole retrieval call chain (retrieve_multi →
# _retrieve_one → retrieve_for_prompt_with_memory) and the /ask handler in
# src/api.py are plain sync functions — an async client here would need an
# event loop none of those callers have.
