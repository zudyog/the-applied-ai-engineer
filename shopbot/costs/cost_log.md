# ShopBot — Cost Log

Every OpenAI API operation is logged here before and after it runs.
Format: one entry per run, most recent at the top.
Evaluation scores are written to `evaluation/results/` after each run.

## Run 002 — RAGAS Evaluation (Book 1 baseline)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2026-07-21 |
| Operation | `python -m evaluation.evaluate` — 20 test cases |
| Run ID | `run_20260721_070927` |
| Models | `text-embedding-3-small` (retrieval) + `gpt-4o-mini` (generation + scoring) |
| Test cases | 20 |
| Queries retrieved | 19/20 (query 09 — winter wedding — correctly returned fallback) |
| Query embedding tokens | 192 (exact, tiktoken) |
| LLM input tokens | 8,092 |
| LLM output tokens | 1,304 |
| Embedding cost | $0.000004 |
| LLM cost | $0.001996 |
| **Total actual** | **$0.002000** |
| Run time | 76.8s |
| Faithfulness | **0.7494** (book1 stated baseline: 0.71) |
| Context Precision | **0.6417** (book1 stated baseline: 0.82) |
| Status | **Completed** |
| Results file | `evaluation/results/run_20260721_070927.json` |
| Checkpoint file | `evaluation/results/run_20260721_070927_checkpoint.json` |

### Score interpretation

Faithfulness **improved** vs book baseline (0.7494 vs 0.71): the V4 prompt's "Stop when
the evidence stops" clause is holding better than V3.

Context Precision **dropped** vs book baseline (0.6417 vs 0.82): expected consequence of
expanding the catalog from 5 → 50 products. With 255 chunks in the store instead of 28,
similar products (9 additional kurtas, 9 sarees) now compete with the correct chunk and
get retrieved alongside it, adding adjacent noise. This is the retrieval precision cost
of catalog expansion. Book 2 addresses it with hybrid search and re-ranking.

### Note on previous failed attempts

Two earlier pipeline runs (~$0.002 each) were lost to asyncio compatibility failures
between ragas 0.1.22 and Python 3.14. Root cause identified and fixed (see CLAUDE.md
Section 17, Issue 3). Checkpoint system added so pipeline results survive future RAGAS
failures.

## Run 001 — Ingest (build Grounding Layer)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2026-07-21 |
| Operation | `python src/ingest.py` — full catalog ingest |
| Model | `text-embedding-3-small` (OpenAI) |
| Encoding | `cl100k_base` (tiktoken exact count) |
| Products | 50 |
| Chunks | 255 |
| Total tokens | 10,905 |
| Price per 1M tokens | $0.02 |
| **Estimated cost** | **$0.000218 (~$0.0002)** |
| Status | **Completed** — 255 chunks ingested successfully |

### Notes
- 6 products have 6 chunks each (p001, p003, p005, p041, p049 — 2 FAQs each; p050 — 1 FAQ)
- Wait: p050 has 5 chunks. Products with 6 chunks: p001, p003, p005, p041, p049 (2 FAQs each)
- Single `embed_documents()` call — all 255 texts in one API request (Ch. 4 design)
- Token counting uses `tiktoken cl100k_base` — exact, not estimated
